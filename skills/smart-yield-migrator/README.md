  # Smart Yield Migrator

  **The Profit Gate for Cross-Protocol DeFi Capital.**

  Runs a 3-step Migration Checklist before recommending any capital move. Never moves a satoshi unless the math says yes.

  1. **The Scanner** - fetches live APY from Bitflow HODLMM, Bitflow XYK, ALEX DEX, and PoX stacking in parallel
  2. **The YTG Filter** - estimates real gas cost from live Stacks network fee samples (not hardcoded), converts to USD
  3. **The Profit Gate** - only recommends MIGRATE if 7-day extra yield exceeds gas cost × 3; otherwise STAY with reason

  ### HODLMM Bonus Eligibility
  - Fetches live HODLMM pool data from `bff.bitflowapis.finance` - 8 pools scanned
  - HODLMM is a valid migration source and destination with concentrated liquidity APY multiplier
  - Pairs with hodlmm-bin-guardian (Day 1) and sbtc-peg-oracle (Day 2) as a complete LAB trilogy
  - Zero hardcoded APYs - all yield data is live from protocol APIs

  ### Part of the LAB Trilogy
  - Day 1 - **Muscle**: [HODLMM Bin Guardian](https://github.com/BitflowFinance/bff-skills/tree/main/skills/hodlmm-bin-guardian) - monitor your position
  - Day 2 - **Brain**: [sBTC Peg Oracle](../day-2-sbtc-proof-of-reserve/) - know market conditions & Audits
  - Day 3 - **Economist**: Smart Yield Migrator - only act when it is profitable

  Built for capital-constrained agents in emerging markets where gas efficiency matters as much as yield.

  ## What it does
  Fetches live APY from every major Stacks yield venue, estimates real gas cost from live Stacks fee samples, then applies a hard profit gate in code: 7-day extra yield must exceed gas cost × 3, before outputting **MIGRATE or STAY** with full checklist and
  break-even timeline.

  ## Does this integrate HODLMM?
  - Yes - eligible for the +$1,000 sBTC bonus pool
