# USDCx Yield Optimizer

**The first autonomous yield deployer for Bitflow's native stablecoin.**

Scans every live USDCx venue on Bitflow, risk-tags each one, applies a Yield-to-Gas profit gate, and outputs executable MCP commands to deploy USDCx to the highest-yielding HODLMM pool. From analysis to action in one command.

> **Write-ready.** Generates deployment specs for HODLMM liquidity router with `--confirm`. Spec-only until MCP adds `trait_reference` support (see Write Capability Status). Mainnet only.

---

## What it does

Five-step pipeline: **Position -> Scan -> Risk-tag -> Gate -> Act**

**Step 0 — Position** (on-chain read):
When `position` is called, reads the wallet's HODLMM bin placements, balances, and active bin distance directly from on-chain pool contracts via `call-read-only`. No signing required. Covers 3 unique pool contracts (sBTC/USDCx, STX/USDCx, aeUSDC/USDCx).

**Step 1 — Scan** every USDCx venue in parallel:
- 7 Bitflow HODLMM concentrated liquidity pools (sBTC/USDCx, STX/USDCx, aeUSDC/USDCx, USDh/USDCx)
- Bitflow XYK passive LP pools (aeUSDC pairs)
- Hermetica sUSDh vault (as a suggested route via sBTC swap)

**Step 2 — Risk-tag** each venue:
- Stablecoin HODLMM pairs (aeUSDC/USDCx, USDh/USDCx): **low risk** — no impermanent loss, no volatile exposure
- STX/USDCx pools: **medium risk** — impermanent loss from STX volatility
- sBTC/USDCx pools: **medium** if sBTC reserve GREEN, **high** if YELLOW/RED
- Hermetica route: **medium risk** — requires sBTC exposure + protocol risk

The sBTC reserve signal is derived from live price deviation (sBTC/BTC) — no external oracle dependency.

**Step 3 — Gate** (Yield-to-Gas profit gate):
When `--from` is specified (agent is already in a venue), applies the YTG rule: `7d extra yield > gas cost x 3`. Prevents churn — never migrate for marginal APY gains that gas costs would eat.

**Step 4 — Act** (MCP command generation):
When `--confirm` is passed with `--amount`, generates executable `call_contract` MCP command specs targeting the recommended pool's active bin. Without `--confirm`, runs in dry-run mode — analysis only, no executable output. Deployment capped at 5,000 USDCx per operation (enforced in code).

---

## Why agents need it

**One question:** "I'm holding USDCx — where should it be earning yield right now, and is it safe?"

USDCx is Bitflow's native stablecoin, live across 7 HODLMM pools and XYK venues, plus swap routes to Hermetica. Before this skill, an agent had to manually check each pool, estimate risk, compare APRs, and figure out the contract parameters — across 7+ venues with different fee structures. Now it's one command.

**Five problems, one skill:**

1. **Where is my USDCx now?** → `position` reads on-chain — which pool, which bins, in-range or not
2. **What are all my options?** → `run` scans 7 HODLMM pools + XYK + Hermetica in one call
3. **Which option is safest?** → Risk-tags each venue (stablecoin=low, STX=medium, sBTC=depends on reserve health)
4. **Is moving worth it?** → Profit gate: "will 7 days of extra yield cover 3x the gas to migrate?"
5. **How do I execute?** → Generates the exact contract call spec for the winning pool

Especially valuable for autonomous agents managing stablecoin reserves, where capital efficiency matters but safety matters more.

## Safety notes

- **Write-ready.** Generates complete `call_contract` deployment specs with `--confirm`. Currently spec-only due to MCP `trait_reference` limitation (see "Write Capability Status" section). Dry-run by default.
- **`--confirm` required** — without this flag, the skill only analyzes and recommends. No deployment specs generated without explicit opt-in.
- **Deployment cap: 5,000 USDCx** per operation — enforced in code (`MAX_DEPLOY_USDCX = 5000`), not just documented.
- **Mainnet only.** All endpoints target Stacks and Bitcoin mainnet.
- **Profit gate enforced in code** — not just documented:
  - `PROFIT_GATE_MULTIPLIER = 3` — 7d gain must exceed 3x gas cost
  - `MIN_APY_IMPROVEMENT_PCT = 1.0` — never recommend for <1% APY gain
  - `MIN_TVL_USD = 50,000` — skip pools below this TVL
  - `MAX_SANE_APR = 500` — reject implausible APR values (API spoofing protection)
  - `SBTC_DEV_GREEN_PCT = 0.5` — sBTC price deviation threshold for GREEN signal
- **Graceful degradation:** If any source is unavailable, skill continues with available data and reports `sources_failed`. Status becomes `"degraded"` but output remains valid for available venues.
- Exit codes: `0` = ok, `1` = degraded, `3` = error

## HODLMM Integration

USDCx is the quote currency in 7 active HODLMM pools:

| Pool | Pair | Fee | Type |
|------|------|-----|------|
| `dlmm_1` | sBTC/USDCx | 15+15 bps | Volatile |
| `dlmm_2` | sBTC/USDCx | 15+15 bps | Volatile |
| `dlmm_3` | STX/USDCx | 15+15 bps | Volatile |
| `dlmm_4` | STX/USDCx | 15+15 bps | Volatile |
| `dlmm_5` | STX/USDCx | 15+15 bps | Volatile |
| `dlmm_7` | aeUSDC/USDCx | 3+3 bps | Stablecoin |
| `dlmm_8` | USDh/USDCx | 3+3 bps | Stablecoin |

The skill fetches live APR and TVL for each from the Bitflow App API and ranks them by risk-adjusted return.

| Bitflow App API | HODLMM pool APR, TVL, volume, token USD/BTC prices | `bff.bitflowapis.finance/api/app/v1/pools` |
| Bitflow Ticker API | XYK pool data, volume for APR computation | `bitflow-sdk-api-gateway-*.uc.gateway.dev/ticker` |
| Hiro Fee Rate | Stacks network gas estimate | `api.mainnet.hiro.so/v2/fees/transfer` |
| Hermetica Staking | sUSDh exchange rate for APY estimation | `api.mainnet.hiro.so/v2/contracts/call-read/.../staking-v1` |
| HODLMM Pool Contracts (on-chain) | Active bin, user bins, balances, overall position | `api.mainnet.hiro.so/v2/contracts/call-read/SM1FKX.../dlmm-pool-*` |

## Write Capability Status

This skill generates complete `call_contract` MCP command specs for `add-liquidity-multi` on the Bitflow HODLMM liquidity router (`SM1FKXGNZJWSTWDWXQZJNF7B5TV5ZB235JTCXYXKD.dlmm-liquidity-router-v-1-2`). The command spec includes the exact contract address, function name, bin position, token amounts, pool trait, and token traits — everything needed to execute.

**Current limitation:** The AIBTC MCP `call_contract` tool does not support `trait_reference` arguments, which the HODLMM liquidity router requires for `pool-trait`, `x-token-trait`, and `y-token-trait` parameters. This means the generated commands cannot be executed directly via `call_contract` today.

**What works now:**
- Skill outputs a complete deployment spec with all contract-level parameters
- An agent framework with native Clarity trait support can execute the spec as-is
- The Bitflow SDK `add-liquidity-simple` CLI command handles trait encoding internally — agents with access to the Bitflow skill can use the spec to construct the equivalent call

**What would fix this:**
1. Add `trait_reference` type support to the MCP `call_contract` tool — this is a one-line type addition in the Clarity argument encoder
2. Alternatively, add a dedicated `bitflow_hodlmm_add_liquidity` MCP tool (similar to the existing `bitflow_swap` pattern) that handles trait encoding internally

The skill is architected for write capability — the deployment cap (`MAX_DEPLOY_USDCX = 5000`), `--confirm` gate, active bin fetching, and MCP command generation are all in code and tested. Once the platform adds trait_reference support, the skill becomes fully autonomous with zero code changes.

---

## Composability

This skill is designed to compose with the broader bff-skills ecosystem:

- **sbtc-proof-of-reserve** — For full L1 trustless reserve verification (this skill uses a price-deviation proxy for speed). Pair for high-value decisions.
- **hermetica-yield-rotator** — Execute the suggested route (USDCx -> sBTC -> Hermetica vault) when this skill recommends it.
- **hodlmm-bin-guardian** — Monitor active bin position after deploying USDCx to a HODLMM pool.

---

## Known constraints

- Hermetica APY is estimated from the sUSDh exchange rate growth over time. The estimate improves as the rate baseline ages.
- sBTC reserve signal is a price-deviation proxy (not a full on-chain audit). For high-value decisions, pair with `sbtc-proof-of-reserve` for L1 verification.
- HODLMM APR is based on the last 24 hours of trading volume. Actual returns depend on whether your bins stay in the active range.
